*template.js*
---
One way data-binding to a templated string

Kind of useful libraries:
---
*bind.js*
---
Two way data-binding between objects

*using.js*
---
Functional chaining library

*promisify.js*
---
Converts a function that takes a callback as its last parameter into a function that returns a Promise

Mostly useless libraries:
---
*code.js*
---
Key-input cheat-code detection

*go.js*
---
